"""
    Geospatial data is being obtained from https://gadm.org/index.html
    We are utilizing the Shapefile for the United States, extracting geospatial Geometry
    coordinates at different two levels: state and county. Below describes what the levels
    mean in the context of the files inside the Shapefile

    Level 0: Country as a whole (Useful when we scale to global coordinates)
    Level 1: State
    Level 2: Counties

    Extract Coordinate Geometry From Shapefile:

    Use https://mapshaper.org/ to import the shapefile for the level of data desired
    and then import the corresponding .prj, .dbf, and .shx files to the mapshaper. Finally
    export the data as GeoJSON.
